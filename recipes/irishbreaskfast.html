    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Start your day off with this Irish breakfast — you'll never want cold cereal again. You can face anything after
        this hearty breakfast of eggs, mushrooms, and tomatoes fried with bacon and butter. Slices of Irish soda bread
        are grilled in the skillet and served on the side. It's essential that you serve this breakfast with sweet,
        milky tea.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 thick slices bacon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter or margarine</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>2 small tomatoes, sliced</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups whole mushrooms</li>
        <li>4 slices prepared soda bread</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay bacon slices in a single layer in a large skillet. Fry over medium heat until starting to brown. Fry on both sides. Remove from the pan, but save the grease.</li>
        <li>Add butter to the skillet and melt. Crack eggs into the pan, being careful not to break the yolks. Place tomato slices, mushrooms, and bread into the skillet, keeping everything separate. Fry gently, stirring mushrooms and tomatoes occasionally. Flip bread to brown on both sides.</li>
        <li>When egg whites are set but the yolks are still runny, dish half of everything onto each of two warmed plates and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Recipe Tip</h2>
    <p>To be really authentic, buy back bacon — it's much meatier than the belly bacon more common in America.</p>
